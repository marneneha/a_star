Git Repo
We parted our work instead of working on the same repo and colaborating (idk why) for code thus there are 2 git repo of indivisual contributor
1. https://github.com/marneneha/a_star
2. https://github.com/AnukritiSinghh/project2_dijkstra_pointrobot/blob/main/dijkstra_anukriti_singh.py


Regarding the video:
The video displays the process of path generation, but the pace is too rapid. 
Although you can observe the path generation by dragging the video slider, the duration is so brief that it does not effectively play. 
As a result, there is a plea to adjust the slider to view the video.
